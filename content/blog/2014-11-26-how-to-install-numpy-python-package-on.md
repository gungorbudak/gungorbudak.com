Numpy (Numerical Python) is a great Python package that you should definitely make use of if you're doing scientific computing

Installing it on Windows might be difficult if you don't know how to do it via command line. There are unofficial Windows binaries for Numpy for Windows 32 and 64 bit which make it super easy to install.

Go to the link below and download the one for your system and Python version:<br /><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy</a>

Then, just double click and do usual Windows installation steps.
