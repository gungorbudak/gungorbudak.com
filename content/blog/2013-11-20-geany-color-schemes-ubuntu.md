There is a collection of color schemes for Geany as well.

[Download it on GitHub](https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes) and follow the instructions.

You’ll need to extract and copy all the files in `colorschemes` directory to `~/.config/geany/colorschemes/`

Then, restart Geany and go to `View -> Editor -> Color Schemes` and choose your style.

I’m using Tango.
