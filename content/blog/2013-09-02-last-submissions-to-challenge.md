Today, I submitted *in silico* and experimental data network inference results on Synapse for the next leaderboard on this Wednesday.

For experimental part, I had to exclude edges with FGFR1 and FGFR3 because the data lacks phosphorylated forms of these proteins and networks must be constructed using only phosphoproteins in the data.

Since there was an update for *in silico* part, I had to modify the script and resubmit the results. I will see the score for this part on this Wednesday as well.

Also, I added the scripts to <a href="https://github.com/gungorbudak/netinf-bigcat" target="_blank">a public GitHub repo called "netinf-bigcat"</a>.
