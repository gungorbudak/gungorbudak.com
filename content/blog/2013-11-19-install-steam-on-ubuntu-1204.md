Download `steam_latest.deb` at:

    http://repo.steampowered.com/steam/archive/precise/steam_latest.deb

Double click and open it on `Ubuntu Software Center` and click `Install`

It'll start Terminal and ask password for `sudo` because there are some packages required, enter your password and continue

Next it'll update itself

Done
