In this study, we're going to use a phosphorylation data from a research paper on phosphoproteomic analysis of related cells.

The idea is to use and compare existing methods and develop these methods to be able to better understand the nature of signaling events in these cells and to find key proteins that might be targets for disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment.

This study will be submitted as a research paper so I'm not going to publish any results here for now but I'll mention the struggles I have and solutions I try to solve them.
