This year, 8th <a href="http://www.the-dream-project.org/" target="_blank">Dream Challenge</a> takes place and I will be working on this project as my internship job in <a href="http://www.bigcat.unimaas.nl/" target="_blank">BiGCaT, Bioinformatics, UM</a>. The challenge brings scientists to catalyze the interaction between experiment and theory in the area of cellular network inference and quantitative model building in systems biology (as said on their webpage).

In this competition, I will work on a specific challenge about network modeling, dynamic response predictions and data visualization. The name of this specific challenge is "HPN-DREAM breast cancer network inference challenge" and the information can be found on <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#%21Synapse:syn1720047" target="_blank">this Synapse page</a>.

In this blog, I will write the progression of the project, try to explain the steps and the tools and methods I use and explain more about the challenge.
