title: Install Geany 1.23 on Ubuntu
year: '2013'

Geany is a really nice text editor for Ubuntu. I would recommend it with TreeBrowser and some interface coding are color schemes.

But you’ll need the latest version which is 1.23 for now.

To install this version you need to add PPA, also this will keep it updated when you update your system.

Execute following lines one by one:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:geany-dev/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install geany

Then, when you start Geany you’ll see "This is Geany 1.23" in status bar.
