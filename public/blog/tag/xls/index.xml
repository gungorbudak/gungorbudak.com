      <description>In most of the modern Linux distributions, Libre Office is available and it can be used to convert XLS or XLSX file(s) to CSV file(s) in bash.
For XLS file(s):
for i in *.xls; do libreoffice --headless --convert-to csv &amp;#34;$i&amp;#34;; done For XLSX file(s):
for i in *.xlsx; do libreoffice --headless --convert-to csv &amp;#34;$i&amp;#34;; done You may get following warning but it still works fine:

      <description>This post describes data preprocessing in Salmonella project for Prize-Collecting Steiner Forest Problem (PCSF) algorithm.
Salmonella data taken from Table S6 in Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Salmonella-Infected Cells Identifies Key Kinase Regulators and SopB-Dependent Host Phosphorylation Events by Rogers, LD et al. has been converted to tab delimited TXT file from its original XLS file for easy reading in Python.
The data should be separated into time points files (2, 5, 10 and 20 minutes) each of which will contain corresponding phophoproteins and their fold changes.</description>

      <description>Since we&amp;rsquo;ll be using R for most of the analyses, we converted XLS data file to CSV using MS Office Excel 2013 and then we had to fix several lines using Sublime Text 2 because three colums in these lines were left unquoted which later created a problem reading in RStudio.
The data contains phosphorylation data of 8553 peptides. There are many missing data points for many peptides and since IPI IDs were used for peptides and these are not supported now, we had to convert IPI IDs to HGNC approved symbols although data had these symbols as names but they looked outdated.</description>
