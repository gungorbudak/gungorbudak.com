      <description>You may have to keep both Python version, the old 2 and 3, at the same time due to your projects and they will require corresponding pip installation so you can separately install and maintain packages for both version.
There are multiple ways of installing pip to a system but the version configuration and setting the default version for pip executable can be tricky.
Below is the easiest solution I&amp;rsquo;ve found.</description>

      <description>Valgrind is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection and profiling. Its installation for macOS High Sierra seems problematic and I wanted to write this post to tell the solution that worked for me. I use Homebrew to install it which is the recommended way and the solution also uses it.
So, when you try installing right away, you may get the following error:
brew install valgrind valgrind: This formula either does not compile or function as expected on macOS versions newer than Sierra due to an upstream incompatibility.</description>

      <description>Numpy (Numerical Python) is a great Python package that you should definitely make use of if you&amp;rsquo;re doing scientific computing
Installing it on Windows might be difficult if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to do it via command line. There are unofficial Windows binaries for Numpy for Windows 32 and 64 bit which make it super easy to install.
Go to the link below and download the one for your system and Python version:http://www.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on a project that requires lots of queries on Ensembl databases so I wanted to install Ensembl API to begin with. Since it&amp;rsquo;s programmed in Perl, I will be using Perl in this project.
There is a nice tutorial on Ensembl website for API installation. Here I will describe some steps.
1. Download the API and BioPerl
Go to Ensembl FTP ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/ and download &amp;ldquo;ensembl-api.tar.gz&amp;rdquo; or click here</description>
