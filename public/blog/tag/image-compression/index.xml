      <description>Image compression is mostly needed if you are short of storage on your devices or if you want to serve your images online and you want to optimize them in a way that we load fast which greatly affects how search engines evaluates your content and how users will enjoy your website.
This is especially important if you are also aiming to support for mobile devices and internet connections that are relatively slow.</description>
