      <description>I had some issues installing Valgrind on macOS High Sierra and [posted some tips to successfully install it to the system]({% post_url 2018-04-28-how-to-install-valgrind-on-macos-high-sierra %}). Although I could install the software this way, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work correctly after testing with with several real and dummy C++ codes. It was giving me a memory leak error even with an empty code. So, then I decided to use an Ubuntu 16.04 based Docker container to test the code within the container using the Ubuntu version of Valgrind.</description>

      <description>Valgrind is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection and profiling. Its installation for macOS High Sierra seems problematic and I wanted to write this post to tell the solution that worked for me. I use Homebrew to install it which is the recommended way and the solution also uses it.
So, when you try installing right away, you may get the following error:
brew install valgrind valgrind: This formula either does not compile or function as expected on macOS versions newer than Sierra due to an upstream incompatibility.</description>
