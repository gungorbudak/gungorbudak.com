      <description>This sub-challenge has several requirements:
Directed and causal edges on the models (32 models - 4 cell lines × 8 stimuli) Edges should be scored (normalizing to range between 0 and 1) that will show confidence Nodes will be phosphoproteins from the data Prior knowledge network (that can be constructed using pathway databases) is allowed to be used (actually this is a must for some network inference tools) First thing was to look for existing tools.</description>

      <description>The inference of causal edges are described as the change on a node seen after the intervention of another node. If the curves obtained over time overlap (under intervention or no intervention), then there is no relation. Otherwise, we can draw an edge between those nodes and according to the level, up or down, the edge will be activating or inhibiting. These causal edges are context-specific so in different cell line data, we may have different relations.</description>
