      <description>After fold changes were obtained and HGNC names were found for each phosphopeptide, these were used to construct Salmonella signaling network using PCSF and then with the nodes that PCSF found as well, we generated a matrix which has node in the rows and time points in the columns and each cell shows the presence of corresponding protein under the corresponding time point(s).
The matrix has 658 nodes (proteins) and 4 time points as indicated before: 2 min, 5 min, 10 min and 20 min.</description>
