      <description>Valgrind is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection and profiling. Its installation for macOS High Sierra seems problematic and I wanted to write this post to tell the solution that worked for me. I use Homebrew to install it which is the recommended way and the solution also uses it.
So, when you try installing right away, you may get the following error:
brew install valgrind valgrind: This formula either does not compile or function as expected on macOS versions newer than Sierra due to an upstream incompatibility.</description>
