      <description>There are many cases where we have two sets (e.g. under two different conditions) of things such as transcripts, genes or proteins and we want to compute the significance of the overlap between them. Hypergeometric test is very simple and widely used option for such cases.
I&amp;rsquo;ll use the phyper function in R but you can use the same idea in SciPy (Python).
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have from 200 genes (A);</description>

      <description>I want to share an interesting finding about our research on exon/intron analysis of human evolutionary history.
So I had the genes that emerged at each pass point of human history and I was using Ensembl API to get exons and introns of these genes to perform further analyses.
There was one gene (ENSG00000197568 - HERV-H LTR-associating 3 - HHLA3) with a surprise. Because it&amp;rsquo;s one transcript (ENST00000432224) had an exon (ENSE00001707577) of length 2.</description>
